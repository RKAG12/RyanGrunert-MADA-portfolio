My name is Ryan Grunert, I am a M.S. student in the Comparative Biomedical Sciences program with an emphasis in Population Health through the College of Veterinary Medicine here at UGA. I completed my bachelor's degree in Fisheries and Wildlife at UGA as well. I am a research assistant at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS), and have assisted with research studies on multiple wildlife diseases. In the past, my research focused on testing new control interventions for the Guinea Worm Eradication Program in Chad. Currently, my research focuses on the epidemiology and population genetics of mange in the U.S., primarily in American black bears, but including other mammals as well. My interests include the biology and epidemiology of infectious diseases, spillover of zoonotic diseases, and the implications both of these have on human and animal population health.

### Interesting Fact
I was a competitive swimmer for many years, but now just started learning archery in my spare time.

### Previous Data Analysis Experience
I have an intermediate knowledge of R programming. I have some basic experience using SAS, STATA, SQL, and Tableau as well. I am confident in running basic statistical analyses and data manipulation in R. I'm interested in learning more advanced statistical analyses, and becoming proficient in writing full scripts. I have no previous experience in machine learning or using Rmarkdown, so I'm excited to learn more about both.

#### Olympic Medal Count
I came across this picture visualizing the number of medals won by each country in the Tokyo olympics. Thought I'd share here!
